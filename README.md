# MusicAnalysis
This Python project allows users to create a corpus of lyrical data from their favorite artists (or pull lyrics off the top 100 billboard charts) and perform a linguistic analyis of them. Lyrics of every song from every album of a chosen artist are scrapped from the lyrics.wikia.com website.
